#Description:

# A game where you have to guess the 50 states of the USA.

#Things I learned today:

# How to create a custom shape for the Turtle Library
# The ease of using the 'pandas' library
# Refreshed my memory on how to get the information from a row using pandas vvvvv
#          state_data = data[data.state == answer_state]
# Refreshed my memory on how to create a .csv file with 'pandas' vvvvv
#          new_data = pandas.DataFrame(missing_states)
#          new_data.to_csv("states_to_learn.csv")
# Slowly understanding how to approach problems with an idea of a starting point in mind, but still struggling with that at the moment.
